Opmodes, or operational modes, are the Java programs
you will write in order to control your robot in autonomous
and teleop.

All opmodes written by FTC programmers will extend OpMode
or LinearOpMode, which are defined in the FTC SDK released
at the beginning of each season.

OpMode and LinearOpMode are both abstract classes, so
the programmer will need to implement any abstract methods
in order for the program to work.
